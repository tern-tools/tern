# Welcome to the Tern Project

Tern is an inspection tool to find the metadata of the packages installed in a container image. It runs scripts from the "command library" against the container and collates the information into a Bill of Materials (BOM) report. Tern gives you a deeper understanding of your container's bill of materials so you can make better decisions about your container based infrastructure, integration and deployment strategies.

## Getting Started<a name="getting-started"/>

### Requirements
Tern is currently developed on a Linux distro with a kernel version >= 4.0. Possible development distros are Ubuntu 16.04 or newer or Fedora 25 or newer.
Install the following:
- Git (Installation instructions can be found here: https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
- Python 3.6.2 (sudo apt-get install python3.6 or sudo dnf install python36)

If you happen to be using Docker containers
- Docker CE (Installation instructions can be found here: https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/#server)

Make sure the docker daemon is running.

### Get the code

```
$ python3 -m venv ternenv
$ cd ternenv
$ git clone https://github.com/vmware/tern.git
$ source bin/activate
$ cd tern
$ git checkout -b release v0.1.0
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### To run against a Docker image
If you have a Docker image pulled locally and want to inspect it
```
$ ./tern report -i debian:jessie
```
Take a look at report.txt to see what packages are installed in the Docker image and how Tern got this information. If you encounter any errors, please file an issue.

### To run against a Dockerfile
You can run Tern against a Dockerfile. Tern will build the image for you and then analyze it with respect to the Dockerfile
```
$ ./tern report -d samples/photon_git/Dockerfile
```
Take a look at report.txt to see what packages are installed in the created Docker image and how Tern got this information. Feel free to try this out on the other sample Dockerfiles in the samples directory or on Dockerfiles you may be working with. If it doesn't work for you, please file an issue.

### To get a summary report
To get just a list of packages, you can use the `-s` option to get a summary report.
```
$ ./tern report -s -d samples/photon_git/Dockerfile
```

WARNING: Tern is meant to give guidance on what may be installed in a container image, so it is recommended that for the purpose of investigation, the default report is used. The summary report may be used as the output of a build artifact or something to submit to a compliance or legal team.

### To run a test
```
$ cd ternenv
$ source bin/activate
$ git clone https://github.com/vmware/tern.git
$ cd tern
$ export PYTHONPATH=`pwd`
$ python tests/<test file>.py
```
