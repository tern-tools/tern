# Project Road Map

## 2022
- Create a Kubernetes admission controller for Tern
- Create a database backend with an associated API.
- Automate aspects of Tern's release process. 


We will also continue to work on the following:
- We will continue to support the SPDX format for container images. To that end, we will make changes to update the format of the document as the [spec](https://spdx.org/sites/cpstandard/files/pages/files/spdxversion2.1.pdf) evolves.
- As usual, we will continue to work on our technical debt and bug fixes.

This timetable is based on time, resources and feedback from you and will change accordingly.
