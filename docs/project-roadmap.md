# Project Road Map

Tern is an open source project with limited resources. In 2023 we will primarily focus on bug fixing and step back from active feature development.

We will continue to support the SPDX format for container images. To that end, we will make changes to update the format of the document as the [spec](https://spdx.github.io/spdx-spec/) evolves.

This timetable is based on time, resources and feedback from you and will change accordingly.
