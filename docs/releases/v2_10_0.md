# Release 2.10.0

## Summary
The long-awaited "Beta" release for Tern is now available! This release is the usual mix of new features, bugs and technical debt cleanup. Specifically, this release added several enhancements that enable Tern to run as a job on Kubernetes. Source package information is also now available in SPDX reports which enable SPDX document consumers to look up CVE information for `rpm` and `deb` based package managers using the Tern report. Additionally, Tern now collects Scancode extension information in conjunction with Tern's default metadata collection method. Previously, these two collection methods operated independently which led to inconsistent report output. Special thanks to our users for opening bugs that helped drive a significant number of bug fixes in this release.

## New Features
* [Add instructions for Kubernetes Job](https://github.com/tern-tools/tern/issues/1111): Now that Tern uses skopeo to pull container images it can be run as a job on Kubernetes using volume mounts with minikube.
* [Add option to use custom log file](https://github.com/tern-tools/tern/issues/1113): This new CLI option enables users to direct the Tern log file to the mount directory when running Tern with minikube instead of leaving it in the container. Use `tern -l <absolute_path_to_log_file>` to re-direct the log file.
* [Add source package info to SPDX reports](https://github.com/tern-tools/tern/issues/1094): Source package information is now available in the SPDX report formats when source package metadata is available (currently for `rpm` and `dpkg` based package managers). It reports source packages on a per-layer basis for binary package objects that contain corresponding source package information. In order to represent the source information, the source package is presented as its own package element and described using a `GENERATED_FROM` relationship with the corresponding binary package. This new feature makes it easier for SPDX document consumers to look up CVE information for `rpm` and `dpkg` package managers which currently report CVE information by source package.
* [Collect extension and default metadata together](https://github.com/tern-tools/tern/issues/1109): Previously, if no cache file existed and you ran Tern with an extension like Scancode, the output report would only include Scancode extension information. This new feature changes the behavior of Tern to report default Tern package metadata information in addition to extension information as this is what was expected by users. This is also important because Tern now produces consistent results regardless of the existence of a cache file. 

## Bug Fixes
* [Enable packages installed by 'python3 -m pip'](https://github.com/tern-tools/tern/issues/1020)
* [Collect package information for SLES based images](https://github.com/tern-tools/tern/issues/1122)
* [debug: Fix argument name and provide driver](https://github.com/tern-tools/tern/issues/1123)
* [Allow explicitly turning off src-tls-verify](https://github.com/tern-tools/tern/issues/1087)
* [Modification of package format for pip](https://github.com/tern-tools/tern/issues/1130)
* [Make licenses data OWASP compatible](https://github.com/tern-tools/tern/issues/1137)
* [Remove underscores from SPDXIDs](https://github.com/tern-tools/tern/issues/1143)
* [Cyclonedx: Correctly lowercase purl package names](https://github.com/tern-tools/tern/issues/1140)
* [Cyclonedx: Correction of the purl generation for apk package](https://github.com/tern-tools/tern/issues/1131)
* [Fix logic error in binary detection](https://github.com/tern-tools/tern/issues/1156)

## Technical Debt
* [Gracefully handle unknown/unsupported extension](https://github.com/tern-tools/tern/issues/827)
* [Install skopeo in Dockerfile.scancode](https://github.com/tern-tools/tern/commit/95a54ac6cf73ccfe2228e40858e783342d4bedee)
* [Do not add selinux xattrs to file data](https://github.com/tern-tools/tern/issues/108)

## Future Work
* [Create an API to run Tern as a service in Kubernetes](https://github.com/tern-tools/tern/issues/1112)
* [Report applicable package licenses as SPDX identifiers instead of LicenseRefs](https://github.com/tern-tools/tern/issues/1147)
* Improve test report validation
* The usual bug fixing/technical debt cleanup
